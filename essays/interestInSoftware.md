When I first started college, I began in Computer Engineering, since I really wanted to sit in the intersection between computer science and electrical engineering, wanting the chance to hop into software engineering, but also the chance to do electrical/hardware jobs. However in Fall of 2023, I actually switched my major to Electrical Engineering. That being said, I still actually have the same goal of wanting the chance to hop into tech. So why did I switch my major to electrical engineering? Am I crazy?

As I said in the beginning, I wanted to sit in the intersection of computer science and electrical engineering, hoping that I would have a good general grasp of both through my computer engineering degree. In my first internship season (first time trying to sell myself to the world), I actually tried to learn more towards the electrical engineering side of computer engineering in order to succeed in both getting the internship, and doing the internship itself. However, while I was at my first internship at HART, I realized that most people who make their way into these electrical engineering roles actually have electrical engineering degrees, not "half electrical engineering" like computer engineering really is! I decided that, to lean into the general electrical engineering field, I needed to switch my major to electrical engineering.

Still, this didn't change my goal of hopping into both tech and EE, and I'm currently trying to find a unique, niche intersection of both. Despite currently being an EE, many of my projects are actually web projects, since that was the main exposure to programming I had from before my college days. Ideally in the future, I'd like to find a way to apply my electrical engineering degree towards a more programming oriented type of job. In all cases, I feel a lot more satisfaction in programming, since I simply just enjoy the process of it. My choice to take my Software Engineering I class is based on the want to deepen my knowledge on important software principles, which I hope I can incorporate into my goal of sitting in the intersection between computer science and electrical engineering.
