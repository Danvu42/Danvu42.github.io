## Me
I've actually done so many HTML and CSS projects on the side throughout the years, and the biggest lesson I've learned through doing so many of these haphazard html/css projects is that there are so many different ways to do one thing. Throughout all this time, I've really only stuck to my own methods of doing things, meaning that once I've found "the way", I never look back on other methods. With this naiive mindset I've held all the way to this year, I've been living in utter bliss about my shiny frontend skills.

## Introducing: Bootstrap 5
Failing one of my frontend coding exams (albeit a practice one) was truly a humbling experience. This was because my software engineering class actually asked me to step out of my blissful world and really throw me into something completely new. 

However, I do find plently of value in learning bootstrap, and I actually enjoy how easy it is to build very functional and even responsive web applications really quickly. To add on to the quickness aspect, I definitely appreciate how nice the default styles look, meaning that I don't need to spend precious time messing around with how to make my button text centered/the right color/the right font/the right size. Something that I found really cool was the ability to make navbars relatively simple, as navbars in my experience have usually been the most frustrating thing to design in any website. The grid system for bootstrap is something to definitely get used to, but it is something that makes complete sense, and I would predict that once I really get the hang of it, I'll pop out websites like an absolute machine.

An interesting thing I see in my own perspective of bootstrap is the very distinctive look of bootstrap, meaning that it seems very possible to make a very "bootstrappy" looking website. For example, I could definitely imagine myself making a website that looks like this:

<p align="center">
<img width="700" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Twitter_Bootstrap_Under_Firefox_32.png">
</p>

However, this may actually be a good thing, since even the "bootstrappy" looking website is still quite aesthetically pleasing, and in the case where you just need to spin up a quick UI to show off a cool backend-type project, this UI is more than enough.

Still, you can make some really unique and super cool websites using bootstrap. For example, this website looks nothing like that "bootstrappy" look:


<p align="center">
<img width="700" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bootstrapbayblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cozar1.png?w=750&ssl=1">
</p>

## Conclusion
In the end, all tools are just what a software developer makes of it. I am looking forward to making more of these bootstrap websites, a big thing I will shoot for in the coming weeks with frontend development is my ability to create websites in a rapid fire kind of way.
