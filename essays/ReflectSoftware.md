Now that you are almost done with this class, I would like you to write on last essay that summarizes what you’ve learned about software engineering.

Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development. Of course, web application development is a skill you’ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:

    Open Source Software Development
    Configuration Management
    Functional Programming
    Development Environments
    Coding Standards
    User Interface Frameworks
    Agile Project Management
    Design Patterns
    Ethics in Software Engineering

For this essay, reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.

Be careful and do not assume the reader understands what “configuration management” or “design patterns” or whatever means. You must define these terms if you are using them.

## What am I really getting into?

Finishing up debugging my last testcase for my final project in ICS 314, I've become super surprised about how much time I spend in a flow state of fixing bugs and implementing features, very happy with the fact that I easily no mind to how huge the final iteration of the ~~spaghetti~~ codebase has actually gotten. The culmination of all the the core software engineering concepts was tested in this final project. We went through concepts like:

- User interfaces
- Version control
- Configuration Management
- Development Environements
- Functional programming
- Coding standards

Just to name a few. 

The development of these skills really crept up on us slowly. I went through near-failure after near-failure of the weekly code exams we were required to do in ICS 314 not really understanding how quickly we were progressing through all aspects of fully functioning software furnished with databases, user interfaces, and fancy algorithms. My final project isn't the last place that these skills are going to be crucial for; they're things that are core to a future career in software engineering.

### Development environments: inconvenient or an absolute blessing?

Throughout this class, I've noticed that development environments have been one of the most frustrating aspects of software engineering, simply because of the number of moving parts that go into them. Put in a simple definition, development environments are places where programmers or software developers can implement changes to their software. These changes are made on their local system, not on the production system, in order to not disrupt regular service. These systems often require plenty of configuration and they also often break due to many reasons related to software updates, missing packages, or simply misconfiguration. Additionally, when developers collaborate on software, they often have to run a local copy on their own machine, syncing with others using version control. Since many applications require all kinds of pre-built software to run properly on their local machine, it gets very tricky for developers when they want to work together.

Fortunately, the systems and tools used to run these development environments can actually be very simple to grasp conceptually, and personally, they've made me really appreciate how easy I have it in the modern age. This class has helped me get a taste of how developers actually run their code in real systems. It may not exactly be meteor framework (our web app platform of choice), but the formula for setting up development environments is generally very much the same for Javascript programming. For most projects utilizing Javascript, node package manager (npm) was used to maintain all of the additional software. 

For the most part, the meteor framework and node package manager does all the heavy lifing for a developer. Sure, it may be more complex to use these environments compared to running toy programs off a single javascript file or applet, but no modern web app runs off the development environments you'd find in an intro programming class. ICS 314 is meant to prepare students for realistic, practical development. One of the biggest things I've learned from this class is learning to grasp the fundamentals of setting up these complex frameworks and learning that there really is nothing scary about working with massive frameworks with so many moving parts
