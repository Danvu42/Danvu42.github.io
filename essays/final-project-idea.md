## Overview

### Problem:
Students can often encounter challenges in quickly finding bathrooms in a university, let alone finding one that is clean and accessible. Currently, there is no efficient way for students and faculty to share feedback on restroom condition.

### Solution:
Manoa Restroom Rater is a web app designed to address the issue of bathroom accessibility by providing a platform for students and faculty to rate and provide feedback on bathrooms around the UH campus. Restrooms each have a page where they can review and rate its cleanliness, discuss accessibility, and provide location. Students could also upload moderated pictures of the restroom to provide students with some insight on the condition of the restroom.

## Approach
Users can browse through a list of available campus restrooms and sort by location/building. Each restroom listing will provide information about the building name, floor, and other specific information. 

Users will also be able to see some reviews of the bathroom, which will contribute to a campus wide ranking of bathrooms.

Only people with a campus account will be allowed to leave reviews/ratings upon using a restroom. Site moderators will oversee the platform to make sure the content is appropriate.

2. Moderators see all user activities and makes sure all uploaded and submitted information is appropriate and valid
3. User logs in, and submits a new bathroom to the database, or makes edits to an existing one

## Beyond the Basics
