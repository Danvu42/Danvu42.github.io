### I. Introduction

In the emerging age of AI tools such as ChatGPT or Bing Copilot, many aspects of technology are constantly having to readapt to changes caused by artificial intelligence tools. Since technology has such a huge importance in work and education, many people face changes in their daily workflows and educational journeys. 

Language models such as ChatGPT and Bing copilot are not only good at natural human languages; they are also great at programming languages. In the education field, ChatGPT has completely affected how computer science and engineering students study programming and software in general. 

AI tools can be used to generate all kinds of code, including typical algorithms, and even full games. These capabilities can be far reaching, and they are often able to complete many computer science assignments that require the answering of programming prompts. In my own experience, I have used it to solve very trivial algorithms; ones that you may see in an introductory course in computer science. I have also used these tools to troubleshoot and debug possible errors in code, and have prompted AI tools to program snippets that get a specific output.

However, these tools can have many limitations. For one, they are not able to see the entirety of large projects. For example, if a software assignment deals with anything more than multiple files that link together, ChatGPT has a difficult time making sure that all the required modules and prerequisite software is taken care of. 

AI tools can't help with development environments yet, which is a large part of software development itself. In ICS 314, setting up development environments and running large, bulky javascript platforms are a major skill to learn in the class. ChatGPT can only help with the steps required to set up these environments, but cannot actually execute them.

In ICS 314, the extent of my use for AI tools has only gone as far as producing examples of functions that may be used for the in class WODS and for inspiration in formatting certain written assignments.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

      - For the Experience WODS, we were tasked with various software assignments that eventually built up to the skill level required to start making full-stack software. These all had solutions at the end of the assignment. At the beginning, the experience were mostly small pieces of code. These prompts were actually possible to have AI tools solve, but I never used any AI tools, since all the experiences had solutions at the end. As the semester went on, the experiences got more complex, spanning more files and running on more complex development environments. On these assignments, it was not as possible to use AI tools, since the development process got so complex. Still, using AI tools was not necessary due to the solutions at the end of each experience.

  2. In-class Practice WODs
      - For the in class practice WODs, I would use ChatGPT once or twice for the assignments. In these times I have used ChatGPT, I used it as a last resort for solving a WOD prompt, whenever I was not able to get the correct output. Underscores practice WOD, I asked ChatGPT the prompt "Write a class that would fulfill the following requirements: (WOD requirements)." In an in class practice WOD for the Underscores framework, I asked ChatGPT to "create functions for the following requirements listed here: (description for each output needed for each function in WOD)." Outside of these instances, I usually was able to solve the in class practice WOD, or would just simply be fine with failing the practice WOD.

  3. In-class WODs
      - For the real in class WODs, I used AI tools twice to provide notes/examples and to debug my WOD submission. One instance where I used ChatGPT was to create examples of multiple Underscores functions in the Javascript 3 WOD. In another instance, in the Coding Standards WOD, I used ChatGPT to look for any bugs in my code in regards to Underscore, which instructed me to add a return to the underscore function, helping me get the right output.

  4. Essays
      - For writing essays, there was extremely little use of AI, since most of the prompts required a personal opinion on the various subjects or asked for personal anecdotes. Because of the personal nature of all of the essay prompts, I really just typed out every single answer to every prompt asked in ICS 314 essays.

  5. Final project
      - For the Final Project, there were many instances where I used AI to write ideas, debug code, and even make certain implementations. Firstly, I used ChatGPT to generate a template for the entry for my custom final project idea about a restroom rating app. While I did not get to choose the restroom rating app as my final project idea, I used ChatGPT to help with my implementation of a rating system in my Manoa food rating final project for ICS 314. Specifically, I used it for creating a star display function for the rating system. I prompted it to create a simple frontend star display of the star rating, giving it my code I used for the rating input function in the Manoa food rating final project.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
      - I never used ChatGPT for learning concepts that were covered in ICS314. This is because I only ever learned concepts through the learning experiences, which always provided examples and solutions themselves. To learn concepts, I mainly completed the experiences, which allowed me to "learn by doing." Because I never used AI for these experiences and only used experiences to learn concepts, I never used AI for learning concepts or for tutorials.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
      - Throughout the semester, I never answered a question in class or in Discord, and therefore, had no opportunity to use AI in this task.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
      - I actually never asked or answered anything in smart-questions in the Discord (besides asking one clarifying question), and therefore, had absolutely no opportunity to use AI in this task. In asking my clarifying question in response to smart question, I never asked AI to help me ask the clarifying question.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
      - As mentioned under the in class WOD section, I actually used ChatGPT to give several examples of the use of several Underscore functions. Specifically, I asked ChatGPT to provide coding examples for use in the Javascript 3 

  10. Explaining code

  11. Writing code

  12. Documenting code

  13. Quality assurance
