### About 
The HART Comms App is an app developed by me that serves the purpose of aiding Core Systems engineers with doing inspections of communications equipment for the Honolulu Rail Transit Project. The app would streamline the process for communications equipment inspections, allowing for quick "hotkey actions" and quick note-taking. This project was developed solely by me, using React Native and Expo Go. This project was a very open ended one, with the intern mentor giving much leniency in the specifications. 

### Role
This project was tasked solely to me by an engineer that wanted a more streamlined way to do Comms equipment inspection. I developed the design and functionality of the app, which included making mockups in Figma and programming the app itself. Throughout the project, I did have plenty of support along the way from my mentor.

### Learning Outcomes
From this project, I was able to gain a lot of experience with Javascript and React Native. For this project, I did also have to have a good understanding of how field inspections worked, which was quite valuable for understanding the construction field at large. I gained familiarity with the React Native platform Expo Go, which I particularly enjoy for its ease of setup.
